Step 1: Installing Docker plugin and configuring Docker cloud
Add Docker cloud by accessing Manage Jenkins 🡪 Configure system. Then, you have to add Docker cloud details as shown below:
Docker Host URI: unix:///var/run/docker.sock
 
Configure the Docker cloud to give complete access to docker.sock file so that Jenkins will be able to connect to Docker process
chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
 

Step 2: Configuring Jenkins job
Create a new Jenkins pipeline job for supporting CI/CD workflow
 
Configure Git repository so that we can have Dockerfile to build Docker container and push it to Docker Hub
https://github.com/Anuj1990/Docker.git

 

Configure build triggers to enable Poll SCM feature so that once any push is detected
 

Configure Docker build option to configure build configurations. Some of the configurations are mentioned below:
Directory for Dockerfile			.	(Represents current location)
Docker Registry URL					https://index.docker.io/v1/
Docker credentials					Docker hub username password
Cloud 					Select Docker Cloud created in dropdown
Image					anujsharma1990/phpcode:${BUILD_NUMBER}
Registry Credentials					Docker hub username password
 

Please Note: We have configured how our custom Docker image will be pushed to    Docker Hub. Now, we have to configure the Docker container deployment.

Follow the steps mentioned below to configure how Docker containers will be deployed
Docker cloud				Select from dropdown Docker cloud details
Docker image				anujsharma1990/phpcode:${BUILD_NUMBER}

 

Once job configuration is done, save the configuration and proceed with triggering build in order to build custom container and deploy the container
 

 

Once the build is successful, validate the Docker container deployment on Docker host which will help us to implement complete CI/CD workflow for Docker container
 


Step 3: Pushing the code to your GitHub repositories
Open your command prompt and navigate to the folder where you have created your files.
cd <folder path>
Initialize your repository using the following command:
git init
Add all the files to your git repository using the following command:
git add .
Commit the changes using the following command:
git commit .  -m “Changes have been committed.”
Push the files to the folder you initially created using the following command:
git push -u origin master
